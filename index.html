            Maize (/meÉªz/ MAYZ; Zea mays subsp. mays), also known as corn in North American and Australian English, 
            is a cereal grain first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago.
            The leafy stalk of the plant gives rise to inflorescences (or "tassels") which produce pollen and 
            separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that when fertilized yield kernels or seeds, which are botanical fruits.
            <br>
            The term maize is preferred in formal, scientific, and international usage as the common name 
            because it refers specifically to this one grain whereas corn refers to any principal cereal crop cultivated in a country. 
            <br>
            For example, in North America and Australia corn is often used for maize, but in England and Wales 
            it can refer to wheat or barley, and in Scotland and Ireland to oats.

            First cultivated by humans in what is today Mexico to adapt to a wide variety of conditions and still produce
             comparatively large amounts of grain, maize relies on humans for its propagation. 
             <br>
             It has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with the total production of maize surpassing that of
              wheat or rice. In addition to being consumed directly by humans (often in the form of masa), 
              maize is also used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup.
